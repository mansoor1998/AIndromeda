# AIndromeda

A landing page for our new startup AIndromeda.
AIndromeda, an Gen AI solutions company, we adeptly manage complex datasets for businesses, developers, and research institutions. Using LangChain and OpenAI API, our app can quickly and effectively train on Github repos and can interpret custom large database, offering up-to-date insights on newer frameworks. As a cost-effective solution, AIndromeda apps optimize API calls and highlights undocumented elements of datasets. Future updates will introduce a "Stack Helper" application.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
